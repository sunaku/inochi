      This release adds support for unit testing, improves the portability of **Inochi** and configurability of your projects, adds new content to the user manual, and fixes some bugs.

      <% paragraph "New features" do %>
        * Added <%= xref "Test your project", "support for unit testing" %> via the [minitest](http://rubyforge.org/projects/bfts/) library.

          * The scaffold generator now emits a default unit test for the main project library.

        * Added optional ProgramName parameter to the scaffold generator.  This allows you to specify reasonable program names when your project module has a strange capitalization:

              # inochi ERBook
                create  er_book/LICENSE

              # inochi ERBook erbook
                create  erbook/LICENSE

              # inochi ERBook foobar
                create  foobar/LICENSE

        * Allow project authors to be specified via

          `Inochi.init :YourProject, :authors => [['name', 'mail']]`

          (Florian Gilcher)
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph "Bug fixes" do %>
        * Run on both JRuby and normal Ruby in multiple versions and with different executable names on Windows. (Florian Gilcher)

        * Use `Gem::RubyGemsVersion` instead of a shell command to determine rubygems version for generation of <tt>setup.erb</tt>. (Florian Gilcher)

        * Add blank lines between all list items, not just multi-line ones, in the plain-text version of the relase announcement for improved readability.

        * Omit LaTeX-style heading numbers from release announcements.  They caused confusion, especially in plain-text announcements, when trying to determine which version of a project was released.
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph "Housekeeping" do %>
        * Added unit tests for utility methods provided by the **Inochi** module: project name calculation and CamelCase to snake\_case conversion.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% section "Version 0.1.0 (2009-01-13)" do %>
      This release reattempts to fix the [circular dependency problem](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281) that occurred when installing either **Inochi** or **ERBook**.

      <% paragraph "New features" do %>
        * `Inochi.init()` now adds `#major()`, `#series()`, and `#requirement()` instance methods to a project's `VERSION` constant.
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph "Bug fixes" do %>
        * Solved circular dependency problem by making inochi gem not dependent on erbook gem.  However, ERBook is still required during runtime and is supplied on the `gem install` command for **Inochi**.

          <%= xref "Installation" %> has been updated accordingly.

        * Add forgotten Rake dependency for **Inochi** gem.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% section "Version 0.0.1 (2009-01-13)" do %>
      This release fixes some show-stopper bugs.

      <% paragraph "Bug fixes" do %>
        * The name of the project library was [being determined incorrectly](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771351). (Florian Gilcher)

        * There was a [circular dependency problem](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281) when installing the **Inochi** gem. (Florian Gilcher)

          The solution is to specify the <tt>--force</tt> option when installing the gem.  <%= xref "Installation" %> has been updated accordingly.

        * Generated project scaffolds now check against the major version of the **Inochi** gem, to avoid runtime version conflicts.
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph "Housekeeping" do %>
        * Only add project libraries to `$LOAD_PATH` if not already there.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% section "Version 0.0.0 (2009-01-13)" do %>
      This is the first release of **Inochi**.

      Happy birthday!
