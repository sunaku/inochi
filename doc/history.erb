    %|section "Version 0.3.0 (2009-02-12)"
      This release adds support for <%= xref "Translate your project", "language translations / internationalization / multilingualization" %>, improves the user interface, and fixes a show-stopper bug for Windows users.

      %|paragraph "New features"
        * Add support for <%= xref "Translate your project", "language translations" %> of phrases used in a project.

          * Add "lang:dump" Rake task for extracting language phrases from project.

          * Add "lang:conv" Rake task for translating dumped phrases into various languages using the BabelFish translation service.

          * Add <tt>--locale</tt> option to a project's main executable for setting user's preferred language in spite of the user's locale environment.

        * Notify user when attempting to publish announcements in the "pub" Rake tasks.

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * In Windows, `ENV['USERPROFILE']` gives the path to the user's home directory and `ENV['HOME']` is not defined.

        * The only real solution to the circular gem dependency problem is:

              gem install --force

          You should update <%= xref "Setup" %> in your projects' user manuals accordingly.

      %|paragraph "Housekeeping"
        * Break the huge <tt>lib/inochi/inochi.rb</tt> library into smaller files.

        * Instead of adding methods to singleton classes directly, define modules and extend to them so that YARDoc documents the methods appropriately.

        * List all project contributors globally in the "Credits" section.

        * Remove "Contributor kudos" paragraph in release notes in favor of crediting contributors inline with each item in the release notes.

        * Mention that the project license is ISC for the reader's convenience.

    %|section "Version 0.2.0 (2009-01-25)"
      This release adds support for unit testing, improves the portability of **Inochi** and configurability of your projects, adds new content to the user manual, and fixes some bugs.

      %|paragraph "New features"
        * Added <%= xref "Test your project", "support for unit testing" %> via the [minitest](http://rubyforge.org/projects/bfts/) library.

          * The scaffold generator now emits a default unit test for the main project library.

        * Added optional ProgramName parameter to the scaffold generator.  This allows you to specify reasonable program names when your project module has a strange capitalization:

              # inochi ERBook
                create  er_book/LICENSE

              # inochi ERBook erbook
                create  erbook/LICENSE

              # inochi ERBook foobar
                create  foobar/LICENSE

        * Allow project authors to be specified via

          `Inochi.init :YourProject, :authors => [['name', 'mail']]`

          (Florian Gilcher)

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * Run on both JRuby and normal Ruby in multiple versions and with different executable names on Windows. (Florian Gilcher)

        * Use `Gem::RubyGemsVersion` instead of a shell command to determine rubygems version for generation of <tt>setup.erb</tt>. (Florian Gilcher)

        * Add blank lines between all list items, not just multi-line ones, in the plain-text version of the relase announcement for improved readability.

        * Omit LaTeX-style heading numbers from release announcements.  They caused confusion, especially in plain-text announcements, when trying to determine which version of a project was released.

      %|paragraph "Housekeeping"
        * Added unit tests for utility methods provided by the **Inochi** module: project name calculation and CamelCase to snake\_case conversion.

    %|section "Version 0.1.0 (2009-01-13)"
      This release reattempts to fix the [circular dependency problem](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281) that occurred when installing either **Inochi** or **ERBook**.

      %|paragraph "New features"
        * `Inochi.init()` now adds `#major()`, `#series()`, and `#requirement()` instance methods to a project's `VERSION` constant.

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * Solved circular dependency problem by making inochi gem not dependent on erbook gem.  However, ERBook is still required during runtime and is supplied on the `gem install` command for **Inochi**.

          <%= xref "Installation" %> has been updated accordingly.

        * Add forgotten Rake dependency for **Inochi** gem.

    %|section "Version 0.0.1 (2009-01-13)"
      This release fixes some show-stopper bugs.

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * The name of the project library was [being determined incorrectly](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771351). (Florian Gilcher)

        * There was a [circular dependency problem](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281) when installing the **Inochi** gem. (Florian Gilcher)

          The solution is to specify the <tt>--force</tt> option when installing the gem.  <%= xref "Installation" %> has been updated accordingly.

        * Generated project scaffolds now check against the major version of the **Inochi** gem, to avoid runtime version conflicts.

      %|paragraph "Housekeeping"
        * Only add project libraries to `$LOAD_PATH` if not already there.

    %|section "Version 0.0.0 (2009-01-13)"
      This is the first release of **Inochi**.

      Happy birthday!
