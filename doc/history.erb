      This release reattempts to fix the [circular dependency problem](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281) that occurred when installing either **Inochi** or **ERBook**.

      <% paragraph "New features" do %>
        * `**Inochi**.init()` now adds `#major()`, `#series()`, and `#requirement()` instance methods to a project's `VERSION` constant.
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph "Bug fixes" do %>
        * Solved circular dependency problem by making inochi gem not dependent on erbook gem.  However, ERBook is still required during runtime and is supplied on the `gem install` command for **Inochi**.

          <%= xref "Installation" %> has been updated accordingly.

        * Add forgotten Rake dependency for **Inochi** gem.
      <% end %>

      This release fixes some show-stopper bugs.

        * Florian Gilcher tried the first release of **Inochi** and reported bugs.

      <% paragraph "Bug fixes" do %>
        * Florian Gilcher reported that the name of the project library was [being determined incorrectly](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771351).

        * Florian Gilcher reported that there was a [circular dependency problem](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281) when installing the **Inochi** gem.

          The solution is to specify the <tt>--force</tt> option when installing the gem.  <%= xref "Installation" %> has been updated accordingly.

        * Generated project scaffolds now check against the major version of the **Inochi** gem, to avoid runtime version conflicts.

      <% paragraph "Housekeeping" do %>
        * Only add project libraries to `$LOAD_PATH` if not already there.

      Happy birthday!
