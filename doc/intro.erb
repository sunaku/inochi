%|chapter "Introduction"


  %|project

    <%= $project %> is an infrastructure for [RubyGems](http://www.rubygems.org)-based software projects that encourages good documentation and reduces programming effort by automating common tasks.


  * <%= xref "History", "What's new?" %> --- history of project releases.
  * [Source code](<%= repo_url %>) --- obtain via <%= repo_scm %> or browse online.
  * [API reference](<%= api_url %>) --- documentation for source code.
  * [Project home](<%= $website %>) --- the <%= $project %> project home page.

  To get help or provide feedback, simply

  %|section "Features"

    <%= $project %> is exciting because:

    * It encourages good documentation:
      * Provides a comprehensive user manual that integrates release notes, setup and usage instructions, and more.
      * Automates the display of help, version, and usage information for your project's main executable.

    * It reduces programming effort:
      * Makes it easy to <%= xref "Translate your project", "translate your project" %> into many languages.
      * Provides a single point of entry to your project's libraries.
      * Keeps your project's configuration in one place.
      * Parses command-line options using [the Trollop library](http://trollop.rubyforge.org).

    * It automates common tasks:
      * Generates project scaffolds while merging changes from previous ones.
      * Provides Rake tasks for packaging, publishing, and announcing your project.

    These features distinguish <%= $project %> from the competition:

  %|section "Etymology"

    In the past, software development was thought to be like mathematical modeling or building construction:  the assembly of inanimate objects.  Nowadays, it is thought to be more like gardening: the cultivation of life!

    In this manner, I consider this project not as a generator of skeletons or as a builder of scaffolds, but as a *giver of life*.  That is why I named this project "inochi", the Japanese word for *life*.

    Happy cultivation!
