      * Provides a comprehensive user manual that integrates release notes, setup and usage instructions, and more.
      * Automates the display of help, version, and usage information for your project's main executable.

    * It reduces programming effort:

      * Provides a single point of entry to your project's libraries.
      * Keeps your project's configuration in one place.
      * Parses command-line options using [the Trollop library](http://trollop.rubyforge.org).

    * It automates common tasks:
      * Generates project scaffolds while merging changes from previous ones.
      * Provides Rake tasks for packaging, publishing, and announcing your project.
      * Integrates with <%= xref "Test execution", "#{test_libs.length} different unit testing libraries" %> for your convenience.


  %|section "Etymology"

    In the past, software development was thought to be like mathematical modeling or building construction:  the assembly of inanimate objects.  Nowadays, it is thought to be more like gardening: the cultivation of life!

    In this manner, I consider this project not as a generator of skeletons or as a builder of scaffolds, but as a *giver of life*.  That is why I named this project "inochi", the Japanese word for *life*.

    Happy cultivation!
