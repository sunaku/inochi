== HISTORY

=== Version 6.0.1 (2011-04-21)

Incompatible changes:

* Remove `pub:ann` tasks; users can manually announce where/if they want to.

Bug fixes:

* Inochi still generated the old `test/helper.rb` file.

* Do not make old and new files read-only before merging.

Housekeeping:

* Revise project & manual version mismatch error.

* Revise project introduction in help manual.

=== Version 6.0.0 (2011-04-21)

This release adopts some common Rails testing and development conventions,
drops runtime gem version dependency establishment in favor of <<Bundler>>,
produces a gemspec file for greater interoperability, and improves merging.

.Incompatible changes

* Remove runtime gem version dependency establishment from `lib/*/inochi.rb`.

* Replace `DEVTIME` constant in `lib/*/inochi.rb` with <<Bundler>>'s Gemfile.

* Rename `RUNTIME` constant to `GEMDEPS` in `lib/*/inochi.rb`.

* Rename `test/helper.rb` to `test/test_helper.rb` per Rails convention.

.New features

* Add `gem:spec` task to generate a gemspec file for your project.

* Allow gem package to be built via `gem build *.gemspec` as
  http://yehudakatz.com/2010/04/02/using-gemspecs-as-intended/[Yehuda Katz
  suggests].

.Bug fixes

* Make old and new files read-only before merging.

.Documentation

* Add diffuse tool to the example merge2 script.

* Reduce font size to accomodate small screens.

.Housekeeping

* Omit CREDITS file from gem: help manual already includes it.

=== Version 5.1.0 (2010-08-14)

This release uses <<Pygments>> for syntax highlighting, adds icons to
admonitions, speeds up the *pub:web* task, and further refines the HTML
version of your project's help manual.

.New features

* Use admonition icons that are installed with AsciiDoc.

* Use Pygments for syntax coloring in AsciiDoc 8.5.4.

.Bug fixes

* Only build what will be uploaded in *pub:web* task.

* Do not display table of contents in print preview mode.

* Increase body max-width to 50em to show 80 characters.

* Update DOM selectors for AsciiDoc 8.5.4 in *ann* tasks.

.Housekeeping

* Get straight to the point when stating project purpose.

=== Version 5.0.2 (2010-08-10)

This release emits hyperlink URLs in the generated UNIX manpage, beautifies
the plain-text release announcement, and fixes incorrect AsciiDoc usage.

.Bug fixes

* Emit hyperlink URLs when rendering the help manual into UNIX manpage format
  by using xsltproc(1) instead of a2x(1).  Thanks to Rainer MÃ¼ller on the
  <<AsciiDoc>> mailing list for
  http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/msg/949fae9deb9f86b8[helping me
  find the solution] to this problem.

* Do not add space before paragraph titles in plain-text announcement.

* Use proper AsciiDoc bibliography syntax in the `BEYOND` file.

.Housekeeping

* Only list related UNIX manpages in the "SEE ALSO" section.

=== Version 5.0.1 (2010-08-09)

This release restores missing metadata in generated gem packages.

.Bug fixes

* Project description and author names were not parsed correctly from the help
  manual when building gem packages.

.Housekeeping

* Redistribute load-order indices in internal Rake task filenames.

=== Version 5.0.0 (2010-08-07)

This release switches from <<Ronn>> to <<AsciiDoc>> for writing the help
manual, reduces the file size of generated gem packages, and fixes some bugs.

.Incompatible changes

* Rename the `inochi.opts` file to `inochi.conf`

* Use <<AsciiDoc>> instead of <<Ronn>> to render the help manual.

** Move "SETUP" and "SYNOPSIS" sections into their own files.

** Rename `SETUP` file to `INSTALL` per Linux convention.

** Add `:man_asciidoc_attributes` option to inochi.conf

* Do not include HTML manual in gem package.  This reduces the gem file size
  and makes the project website the only official place to obtain the HTML
  manual.

.Bug fixes

* Add workaround for `lynx -dump` ignoring <base href="..."/>

* Always load project info before non-init tasks.

* Another Ruby 1.9.2-rc2 fix for Nokogiri usage.

Housekeeping

* Use single quotes for string values in `inochi.rb` template.

* fetch_nodes_between(): report errors and refactor.

=== Version 4.0.1 (2010-07-28)

This release fixes a bug in gem version dependency establishment.

.Bug fixes

* Gem version dependencies were not being established in Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2
  because `Kernel#gem` http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/3617[is a
  private method] in those Ruby versions.
+
To propagate this fix into your projects, please reinitialize them with this
version of Inochi.

=== Version 4.0.0 (2010-07-25)

.Incompatible changes

* Rename the "VERSIONS" section in the `HISTORY` file to "HISTORY".

.Changes you will see in upgraded or newly generated projects

* Rename the `FURTHER` file to `BEYOND`.

* Rename `test/test_helper.rb` to just `test/helper.rb`.

* Store resource URLs in variables in `MANUAL` file for reuse.

* Provide more precise link to ruby-wrapper tool in `HACKING` file.

.New features

* Ensure that project version matches release notes before building a gem.
  This helps to prevent the problem where you sometimes forget to update
  both the release notes and the project information file simultaneously.

* Display announcement message to user (and make them confirm it) before
  publishing to ruby-talk.  This helps to prevent you from appearing inept
  and having to apologize later for your publishing blunders.

* Add `-d` (to enable `$DEBUG`) and `-v` (to enable `$VERBOSE`)
  command-line options to the generated `test/runner` script.

.Bug fixes

* Various compatibility fixes for Ruby 1.9.2-rc2.

* Prefix `test/runner` command with "ruby" for Windows users.

* `Ember::WEBSITE` was always being emitted in `README` file.

.Housekeeping

* Add version constraints for YARD and Mechanize dependencies.

* Upgrade from Dfect 1.1.0 to Detest 3.1.0 for unit testing.

* Upgrade to Ronn 0.7.0 for generating this user manual.

=== Version 3.0.0 (2010-04-27)

.Incompatible changes

* The `require()` class method is no longer emitted on your project's
  namespace.  Instead, gem version constraints are established up front when
  your project's Ruby library is first loaded.

* Author names are now fetched from the "AUTHORS" section, not "CREDITS".

* Project information is now placed in the "NAME" section, not "ABOUT".

.Bug fixes

* Reflect current Inochi version in gem constraint.

* Forgot to list <<Ember>> as a runtime gem dependency.

.Housekeeping

* Move all task documentation into new "TASKS" section.

* Move TASKS & PROJECTS information into separate files.

=== Version 2.0.1 (2010-04-25)

This release fixes some bugs and adds a simple tutorial to the help manual.

.Bug fixes

* Task files were not loaded in correct order.  As a result, certain Inochi
  tasks would fail (depending on the sorting order of your filesystem) with
  the following cryptic error:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inochi aborted!
Don't know how to build task ''
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rake-0.8.7/lib/rake.rb:1728:in `[]'
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `LICENSE` file template lacked a "TODO" marker.

* Forgot version number heading in announcement.

.Housekeeping

* Restored the simple WordCount tutorial from version 1.1.1.

=== Version 2.0.0 (2010-04-24)

This release makes Inochi a development-time dependency only, documents nearly
everything in the help manual, renders the help manual as a UNIX manual page,
simplifies the project infrastructure it provides, and removes needless cruft.

.Incompatible changes

* Inochi is no longer a runtime dependency (gem or otherwise) for projects
  that use it.  It also no longer runs tests, creates project namespaces, or
  provides libraries for internationalization, combinatorics, command-line
  parsing, utility logic, or Rakefiles.
+
See <<PROJECTS>> to learn about the new Inochi infrastructure.

* The help manual is now processed by <<Ronn>> instead of <<ERBook>>.  As a
  result, you may only use plain <<Markdown>> and <<eRuby>> when writing it.

* Announcement publishing tasks no longer read login information from the
  `~/.config/inochi/logins.yaml` file and prompt you to enter that
  information manually instead.  As a result, the forementioned file is no
  longer recognized or used by Inochi so you may safely delete it.

.New features

* The help manual is now available as a UNIX manual page (thanks to <<Ronn>>)
  and is now divided into smaller files that can be read directly without
  needing a special viewer, and are named according to open-source packaging
  conventions (such as README, HACKING, and LICENSE) so that they draw the
  attention of users unaccustomed to the organization of your project.

* A `require` class method is now added to the project's namespace.  This
  method verifies that the library or gem being required meets the
  dependency version constraints defined by the project.

* A `test/runner` script is now generated.  It provides a fast,
  self-contained way to run your project's test suite.

* Inochi is now a Rake application.  A `Rakefile` is not necessary.

.Housekeeping

* Many KISS and YAGNI fueled iterations later, this is it! :-)

* Nearly every aspect of Inochi is now meticulously documented in the help
  manual to the best of my ability.  If I missed something important, please
  notify me or contribute the correction yourself!

=== Version 1.1.1 (2009-10-03)

This release improves Ruby 1.9 support and upgrades gem dependencies.

.Bug fixes

* `require()` was unable to find project library in Ruby 1.9.2dev.

* Ruby 1.9 warning about "shadowing outer variable".

* Ruby 1.9 error about "incompatible encoding regexp match".

.Housekeeping

* The "spicycode-rcov" project was officially renamed to "relevance-rcov".

* Upgrade to RubyForge 2.x library for publishing gems.

=== Version 1.1.0 (2009-09-06)

This release improves the user manual and scaffold generator output, injects
more metadata into gems, adds support for Microsoft web browsers, and fixes
some bugs.

.New features

* Add instructions for building gems without Inochi as a runtime dependency.

* Put release notes in "description" field of gemspec, as
  http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/190220#830072[suggested by Eric Hodel], so
  that subscribers of http://gems.rubyforge.org/index.rss[the RubyForge gems
  feed] are aware of the changes in a published gem.

* Set the "date" field in gemspec to project release date.

* Change file extension of generated user manuals from .xhtml to .html to
  accomodate Microsoft web browsers' inability to process the
  application/xhtml+xml mime type.

.Bug fixes

* The sdoc library was necessary to run 'rake test'.

* Forgot to add `:develop` option to scaffold generator output.

* Make "rake lang:dump" unconditionally overwrite the dump file.

* Fix gem not being built and prevent Maruku errors for the dummy
  "WordCount" project in the user manual.

* Use /usr/bin/env instead of /usr/bin/ruby to launch Ruby for better
  portability.

.Housekeeping

* Use simpler Copyright reminder at the top of every file.

* Open source is for fun, so speak of "related works", not "competitors".

* Rename "Tutorial" to "General walkthrough" in user manual and add a
  "Specific topics" section for housing uncommon use cases.

* Remove "logistics" section and redistribute its contents in more
  suitable locations in the user manual.

=== Version 1.0.0 (2009-05-03)

This release allows your gems to not depend on Inochi, lets you choose which
unit testing library to use, adds new utility libraries and rake tasks, and
fixes some bugs.

.Incompatible changes

* Your program is no longer halted by `Inochi.init()` and `Inochi.rake()` if
  gem dependencies are not satified.  A warning is issued instead.

* The `project_summary` and `project_history` nodes, which are provided by
  `Inochi.book()` to the user manual, have been renamed to `project` and
  `history` respectively.

* ERBook 7.1.0 is now used for generating the user manual.  This is a major
  step up from the previous version, and so it has incompatible changes.
  See its release notes for details.

* http://github.com/voloko/sdoc/tree/master[SDoc] is now used to generate
  API documentation instead of http://yard.rubyforge.org[YARD].  If you
  link to particular classes or methods in the generated API documentation,
  be sure to update your link addresses!

* Minitest is no longer the default testing library.  You must specify which
  testing library you want to use via the `:test_with` option of the
  `Inochi.rake()` method.  See the "Test execution" section for details.

* The "pak" rake task, which is provided by `Inochi.rake()`, has been
  renamed to "gem".

.New features

* Add `:inochi_consumer` and `:inochi_producer` options to `Inochi.rake()`
  which allows you to _avoid_ having Inochi as a runtime and development
  dependency, respectively, for your project's gem.
+
This is useful if you just want to use Inochi facilities for building a
gem for a pure Ruby library that does not have any need for Inochi's
runtime convenience facilities.

* Add `:develop` option for `Inochi.init()` which lets you specify RubyGems
  as development dependencies in the same way as the `:require` option.

* Add "lint" rake task which reports
  http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/11/static-analysis-tool-roundup[code quality
  statistics].

* Add "test:cov" rake task which reports code coverage statistics.

* Add "test:ruby" task which runs all tests with
  http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/multiruby-testing[multiruby].

* Add `rake opts=` environment variable, which lets you specify command-line
  arguments directly to the Ruby interpreter, for all test* rake tasks.

* Add `inochi/util/combo` combinatorics library for enumerations,
  permutations, and combinations which are all useful in exhaustive
  brute-force unit testing.

* Add `inochi/util/tempdir` library which really should be in the Ruby
  standard library.

.Bug fixes

* The "enable email notification" checkbox was not activated properly when
  posting announcement to ruby-talk mailing list via Ruby-Forum.

* Mark gems needed by `Inochi.rake()` as _development_ dependencies.
+
Users must now run `gem install Inochi --development` to install these
dependencies.  This also solves the recursive dependency problem between
Inochi and ERBook.

* Set executable in gem specification only if it exists.

* Fix parsing of stack trace in Ruby 1.9.

.Housekeeping

* Write contributor names in CREDITS file instead of in the user manual.

* Use completely lowercase name for Rakefile.

* Add copyright statement at the top of every source file.

=== Version 0.3.0 (2009-02-12)

This release adds support for language translations, improves the user
interface, and fixes a show-stopper bug for Windows users.

.New features

* Add support for language translations of phrases used in a project.

* Add "lang:dump" Rake task for extracting language phrases from project.

* Add "lang:conv" Rake task for translating dumped phrases into various
  languages using the BabelFish translation service.

* Add `--locale` option to a project's main executable for setting user's
  preferred language in spite of the user's locale environment.

* Notify user when attempting to publish announcements in the "pub" Rake
  tasks.

.Bug fixes

* In Windows, `ENV['USERPROFILE']` gives the path to the user's home
  directory and `ENV['HOME']` is not defined.

* The only real solution to the circular gem dependency problem is:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gem install --force
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
You should update the "Setup" section in your projects' user manuals
accordingly.

.Housekeeping

* Break the huge lib/inochi/inochi.rb library into smaller files.

* Instead of adding methods to singleton classes directly, define modules
  and extend to them so that YARDoc documents the methods appropriately.

* List all project contributors globally in the "Credits" section.

* Remove "Contributor kudos" paragraph in release notes in favor of
  crediting contributors inline with each item in the release notes.

* Mention that the project license is ISC for the reader's convenience.

=== Version 0.2.0 (2009-01-25)

This release adds support for unit testing, improves the portability of
Inochi and configurability of your projects, adds new content to the user
manual, and fixes some bugs.

.New features

* Added support for unit testing via the
  http://rubyforge.org/projects/bfts/[minitest] library.

* The scaffold generator now emits a default unit test for the main
  project library.

* Added optional ProgramName parameter to the scaffold generator.  This
  allows you to specify reasonable program names when your project module
  has a strange capitalization:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ inochi ERBook
create er_book/LICENSE

$ inochi ERBook erbook
create erbook/LICENSE

$ inochi ERBook foobar
create foobar/LICENSE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Allow project authors to be specified via
  `Inochi.init :YourProject, :authors => [['name', 'mail']]`
  (thanks to Florian Gilcher)

.Bug fixes

* Run on both JRuby and normal Ruby in multiple versions and with different
  executable names on Windows.  (thanks to Florian Gilcher)

* Use `Gem::RubyGemsVersion` instead of a shell command to determine
  rubygems version for generation of setup.erb.  (thanks to Florian Gilcher)

* Add blank lines between all list items, not just multi-line ones, in the
  plain-text version of the release announcement for improved readability.

* Omit LaTeX-style heading numbers from release announcements.  They caused
  confusion, especially in plain-text announcements, when trying to
  determine which version of a project was released.

.Housekeeping

* Added unit tests for utility methods provided by the `Inochi` module:
  project name calculation and CamelCase to snake_case conversion.

=== Version 0.1.0 (2009-01-13)

This release reattempts to fix the
http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281[circular dependency problem]
that occurred when installing either Inochi or ERBook.

.New features

* `Inochi.init()` now adds `#major()`, `#series()`, and `#requirement()`
  instance methods to a project's `VERSION` constant.

.Bug fixes

* Solved circular dependency problem by making inochi gem not dependent on
  erbook gem. However, ERBook is still required during runtime and is
  supplied on the `gem install` command for `Inochi`.
+
The "Installing" section has been updated accordingly.

* Add forgotten Rake dependency for `Inochi` gem.

=== Version 0.0.1 (2009-01-13)

This release fixes some show-stopper bugs.

.Bug fixes

* The name of the project library was
  http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771351[being determined incorrectly].
  (thanks to Florian Gilcher)

* There was a http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281[circular dependency
  problem] when installing the `Inochi` gem.  (thanks to Florian Gilcher)
+
The solution is to specify the `--force` option when installing the gem.
The "Installing" section has been updated accordingly.

* Generated project scaffolds now check against the major version of the
  yInochi` gem, to avoid runtime version conflicts.

.Housekeeping

* Only add project libraries to `$LOAD_PATH` if not already there.

=== Version 0.0.0 (2009-01-13)

This is the first release of Inochi.  Enjoy!
