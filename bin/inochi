#   create:   A file is being created because it does not exist.
#
#   skip:     A file is being skipped because it is already up to date.
#
#   update:   A file will be updated because it is out of date.  A text
#             merging tool (see the "--merger" option) will be launched to
#             transfer content from the old file (*.old) and the new file
#             (*.new) to the out of date file.  If a text merging tool is
#             not specified, then you will have to do the merging by hand.
