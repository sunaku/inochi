== DESCRIPTION

Inochi is an infrastructure that gives life to open-source <<Ruby>> projects
and helps you document, test, package, publish, announce, and maintain them.

=== Features

* Produces a comprehensive help manual that is written in <<eRuby>> over
  <<AsciiDoc>> and is rendered into a Web page (with RSS feed) as well as a
  UNIX manual page.

* Produces beautiful plain-text release announcements that are ready to be
  published on news outlets such as the <<ruby-talk>> mailing list.

* Stores project information in constants in a single Ruby source file.
